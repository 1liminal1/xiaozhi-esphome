I'm currently experimenting with splitting up the YAML into **core**, **hardware**, and **display pages**.  
This way, changes to **core** (or **pages**) will affect all devices, making it easier for me to add or modify the core system.

ðŸ‘‰ If you try this and run into problems, please revert to one of the known working YAMLs.  
And if you believe the issue isnâ€™t just user error, please report back. ðŸ˜‰

## ðŸš€ Installation

1. Copy the YAML for your device (e.g. `Muma.yaml`) into your **ESPHome** configuration.  
   - Keep your own `name:` and `friendly_name:` values.  

2. Install the firmware to your device.  

3. (Optional) Update the **settings** section of the YAML if you want to:  
   - Change the `imagemodel`  
   - Change the `startup_sound`  

4. The **clockbackground** can be set directly from **Home Assistant (HA)**.

After this, if there is a update, all you need to do is compile again.

- **Fixes**  
  - fixed timer widget, fixed clock screensaver so it doesn't go on when timer is running
  - fixed so it also doesnt show clock until api image timer is done.
- **Changes**  
  - changed font for default clock from 30 to 42, and date font from 18 to 22
  - changed timer widget to new design. and removed 1 font (more memory saving ;)
  - removed removed 1 font, saved memory
  - moved micro wake words to main and left only "okay nabu" in core, this gives a wider selection of mmw's without loading all
