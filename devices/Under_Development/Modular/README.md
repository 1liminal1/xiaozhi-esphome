Testing only!

I'm testing splitting up the yaml into core, hardware and pages so changes to core (or pages) will affect all devices,
and ease the work for me when adding or changing the core system.

If you try this and experience problems, return to one of the known working yaml's
(and report back if you think it's not just a user error ;)
