There are only two versions of the Xiaozhi "Ball." The sticker on the bottom does **not** indicate which version you have, so please refer to the images for identification.

**Ball V1:**

* Uses the same pinout as the official breadboard version, so you can run the same code on both.
* Does **not** have touch input or a battery.
* Slightly smaller than V2.
* Speaker is quieter compared to V2.

**Ball V2:**

* Slightly larger than V1.
* Features an optional touch sensor and/or battery support.
* Includes a louder speaker for improved audio.
* Pinout is different from V1, so double-check before flashing.

To identify your Xiaozhi Ball, compare the front and back views with the images provided.
