# Spotpear "Puck"

The Spotpear **“Puck”** (as I like to call it) uses the same code as Ball v2. It features the same hardware and pin configuration.

> **Note**
> If you plan to use your Puck for “walk and talk” scenarios, touch functionality can be problematic—every time the display touches your shirt, it may start or stop the conversation.
>
> If your Puck has a touch screen and you want to use it while walking, you can easily disable the touch feature in the ESPHome code (see Ball v2 configuration).
