These are two small, box-shaped electronic devices called **Muma "Horse"** and **Muma "Box"**. Each has a digital display on one face, and both have a similar black outer casing. The most obvious difference is the **orientation and placement of the screen**:

* **Muma "Horse"**:

  * The display is mounted on a sloped/angled face, so the screen is tilted upwards.
  * The name "Horse" could reference the (optional) legs and how the screen's angle is reminiscent of a "horse" in gymnastics (the pommel horse) or simply a sloped back.

* **Muma "Box"**:

  * The display is mounted on the vertical, front face of the device, so the screen is upright and facing directly forward.
  * The name "Box" fits the straightforward, boxy shape with no angle to the display.
