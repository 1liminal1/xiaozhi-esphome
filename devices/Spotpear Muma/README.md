It's been confirmed that all Muma devices (Horse and Box v1 & v2) is using same firmware, so same yaml: Muma.yaml

Muma "Horse" (v1 & v2) have optional legs and display is mounted on a sloped/angled face, so the screen is tilted upwards.

Muma "Box" (v1 & v2) don't have legs and the screen is upright and facing directly forward.
